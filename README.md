This is my repository of useful js templates.

1. Masonry gallery layout: This was quite a challenge for the first
   item in my repository but I really wanted to do this and I actually need it for the site I'm building. It came out very well but I need to
   find an efficient way to swap lowRes initial images for hiRes while the user enjoys the gallery. I tried with IntersectionObserver but it is overwhelmed by the number of images and doesn't catch every image in the viewport. To be continued...
